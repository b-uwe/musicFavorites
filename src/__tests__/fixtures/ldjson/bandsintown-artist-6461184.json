While the severe part is dead-on, what a medical textbook won’t tell you is that Vulvodynia is also the pioneer in what is rapidly becoming South Africa‟s most eviscerating export.\nSlamming Brutal Death Metal. With lobotomizing, lurid riffs, skinshredding blast beats and slams gruesome and filthy enough to induce septic shock, Vulvodynia are a lethal plague, spreading throughout the flesh of today‟s heavy music scene—infecting one set of ears at a time, and leaving no survivors.\n\nSpawned in 2014 by Vocalist Duncan Bentley and Guitarist Luke Haarhoff, Vulvodynia is a South African slam juggernaut designed with one purpose: to make the craziest, most absurdly heavy music possible, while attempting to define themselves as more than just “another slam band.” If their mission was over-the-top heaviness, then consider it accomplished—from their debut release, \nLord of Plagues, Vulvodynia‟s penchant for skull-splitting technicality and eviscerating heaviness has been obvious.\n\nRapidly gaining popularity and recognition for their prodigal slam \nprowess, Lord of Plagues saw the band reach ears not just in their local scene, but around the world as well. As the band‟s popularity grew, their sound matured, drawing more from a greater array of influences and improving their musicianship and dynamic.\nIn August 2014 the band signed a two-album contract with Australian Label „Vicious Instinct Records‟ and added producer Byron Dunwoody in as the second guitarist, in October of 2014, the band released their debut full-length \nalbum, Cognizant Castigation. If 2014 was the year the band finally grew into their potential, 2015 was the year they shattered their own mold, evolving into an even more aggressive and creative display of no-holds-barred heaviness. The band released a lengthy-but-lurid eight track EP titled Finis Omnium Ignoratium, completing their contract with Vicious Instinct Records. \n\nNo longer satisfied with their status as a terrifying trio, the band sought to expand—searching South Africa for more like-minded musicians willing to bring forth brutality. \nVulvodynia‟s search was not in vain as they found Drummer Thomas Hughes (Fuzigish), Guitarist Kris Xenopoulos \n(Technopath), Bassist Chris Van Der Walt (Boargazm) & Lwandile Prusent to join the band. \n\nWith a full-fledged line-up confirmed, the band made \ntheir first moves with a signing to the legendary Czech-based label Lacerated Enemy Records. After signing to LE Records the band released their third studio album „Psychosadistic Design‟ along with their debut music video for the song „Flesh Tailor‟, The band then embarked on their first EU Tour in 2017 and went abroad twice more for Deathfeast Open Air (DE) & Fall In The Brawl (UK).In 2018 The band embarked on 2 tours through Europe as well as performed at Obscene Extreme Open Air. 2019 saw the band release their 4th studio album ‘Mob Justice’ which sent them touring the US and Australia/New Zealand for the first time as well as 2 Europe tours and a massive festival run.-- proof that there is no way to predict just how far or how fast Vulvodynia‟s sinister infection will spread.",

While the severe part is dead-on, what a medical textbook won’t tell you is that Vulvodynia is also the pioneer in what is rapidly becoming South Africa‟s most eviscerating export.\nSlamming Brutal Death Metal. With lobotomizing, lurid riffs, skinshredding blast beats and slams gruesome and filthy enough to induce septic shock, Vulvodynia are a lethal plague, spreading throughout the flesh of today‟s heavy music scene—infecting one set of ears at a time, and leaving no survivors.\n\nSpawned in 2014 by Vocalist Duncan Bentley and Guitarist Luke Haarhoff, Vulvodynia is a South African slam juggernaut designed with one purpose: to make the craziest, most absurdly heavy music possible, while attempting to define themselves as more than just “another slam band.” If their mission was over-the-top heaviness, then consider it accomplished—from their debut release, \nLord of Plagues, Vulvodynia‟s penchant for skull-splitting technicality and eviscerating heaviness has been obvious.\n\nRapidly gaining popularity and recognition for their prodigal slam \nprowess, Lord of Plagues saw the band reach ears not just in their local scene, but around the world as well. As the band‟s popularity grew, their sound matured, drawing more from a greater array of influences and improving their musicianship and dynamic.\nIn August 2014 the band signed a two-album contract with Australian Label „Vicious Instinct Records‟ and added producer Byron Dunwoody in as the second guitarist, in October of 2014, the band released their debut full-length \nalbum, Cognizant Castigation. If 2014 was the year the band finally grew into their potential, 2015 was the year they shattered their own mold, evolving into an even more aggressive and creative display of no-holds-barred heaviness. The band released a lengthy-but-lurid eight track EP titled Finis Omnium Ignoratium, completing their contract with Vicious Instinct Records. \n\nNo longer satisfied with their status as a terrifying trio, the band sought to expand—searching South Africa for more like-minded musicians willing to bring forth brutality. \nVulvodynia‟s search was not in vain as they found Drummer Thomas Hughes (Fuzigish), Guitarist Kris Xenopoulos \n(Technopath), Bassist Chris Van Der Walt (Boargazm) & Lwandile Prusent to join the band. \n\nWith a full-fledged line-up confirmed, the band made \ntheir first moves with a signing to the legendary Czech-based label Lacerated Enemy Records. After signing to LE Records the band released their third studio album „Psychosadistic Design‟ along with their debut music video for the song „Flesh Tailor‟, The band then embarked on their first EU Tour in 2017 and went abroad twice more for Deathfeast Open Air (DE) & Fall In The Brawl (UK).In 2018 The band embarked on 2 tours through Europe as well as performed at Obscene Extreme Open Air. 2019 saw the band release their 4th studio album ‘Mob Justice’ which sent them touring the US and Australia/New Zealand for the first time as well as 2 Europe tours and a massive festival run.-- proof that there is no way to predict just how far or how fast Vulvodynia‟s sinister infection will spread.",

While the severe part is dead-on, what a medical textbook won’t tell you is that Vulvodynia is also the pioneer in what is rapidly becoming South Africa‟s most eviscerating export.\nSlamming Brutal Death Metal. With lobotomizing, lurid riffs, skinshredding blast beats and slams gruesome and filthy enough to induce septic shock, Vulvodynia are a lethal plague, spreading throughout the flesh of today‟s heavy music scene—infecting one set of ears at a time, and leaving no survivors.\n\nSpawned in 2014 by Vocalist Duncan Bentley and Guitarist Luke Haarhoff, Vulvodynia is a South African slam juggernaut designed with one purpose: to make the craziest, most absurdly heavy music possible, while attempting to define themselves as more than just “another slam band.” If their mission was over-the-top heaviness, then consider it accomplished—from their debut release, \nLord of Plagues, Vulvodynia‟s penchant for skull-splitting technicality and eviscerating heaviness has been obvious.\n\nRapidly gaining popularity and recognition for their prodigal slam \nprowess, Lord of Plagues saw the band reach ears not just in their local scene, but around the world as well. As the band‟s popularity grew, their sound matured, drawing more from a greater array of influences and improving their musicianship and dynamic.\nIn August 2014 the band signed a two-album contract with Australian Label „Vicious Instinct Records‟ and added producer Byron Dunwoody in as the second guitarist, in October of 2014, the band released their debut full-length \nalbum, Cognizant Castigation. If 2014 was the year the band finally grew into their potential, 2015 was the year they shattered their own mold, evolving into an even more aggressive and creative display of no-holds-barred heaviness. The band released a lengthy-but-lurid eight track EP titled Finis Omnium Ignoratium, completing their contract with Vicious Instinct Records. \n\nNo longer satisfied with their status as a terrifying trio, the band sought to expand—searching South Africa for more like-minded musicians willing to bring forth brutality. \nVulvodynia‟s search was not in vain as they found Drummer Thomas Hughes (Fuzigish), Guitarist Kris Xenopoulos \n(Technopath), Bassist Chris Van Der Walt (Boargazm) & Lwandile Prusent to join the band. \n\nWith a full-fledged line-up confirmed, the band made \ntheir first moves with a signing to the legendary Czech-based label Lacerated Enemy Records. After signing to LE Records the band released their third studio album „Psychosadistic Design‟ along with their debut music video for the song „Flesh Tailor‟, The band then embarked on their first EU Tour in 2017 and went abroad twice more for Deathfeast Open Air (DE) & Fall In The Brawl (UK).In 2018 The band embarked on 2 tours through Europe as well as performed at Obscene Extreme Open Air. 2019 saw the band release their 4th studio album ‘Mob Justice’ which sent them touring the US and Australia/New Zealand for the first time as well as 2 Europe tours and a massive festival run.-- proof that there is no way to predict just how far or how fast Vulvodynia‟s sinister infection will spread.",

With lobotomizing, lurid riffs, skinshredding blast beats and slams gruesome and filthy enough to induce septic shock, Vulvodynia are a lethal plague, spreading throughout the flesh of today‟s heavy music scene—infecting one set of ears at a time, and leaving no survivors.\n\nSpawned in 2014 by Vocalist Duncan Bentley and Guitarist Luke Haarhoff, Vulvodynia is a South African slam juggernaut designed with one purpose: to make the craziest, most absurdly heavy music possible, while attempting to define themselves as more than just “another slam band.” If their mission was over-the-top heaviness, then consider it accomplished—from their debut release, \nLord of Plagues, Vulvodynia‟s penchant for skull-splitting technicality and eviscerating heaviness has been obvious.\n\nRapidly gaining popularity and recognition for their prodigal slam \nprowess, Lord of Plagues saw the band reach ears not just in their local scene, but around the world as well. As the band‟s popularity grew, their sound matured, drawing more from a greater array of influences and improving their musicianship and dynamic.\nIn August 2014 the band signed a two-album contract with Australian Label „Vicious Instinct Records‟ and added producer Byron Dunwoody in as the second guitarist, in October of 2014, the band released their debut full-length \nalbum, Cognizant Castigation. If 2014 was the year the band finally grew into their potential, 2015 was the year they shattered their own mold, evolving into an even more aggressive and creative display of no-holds-barred heaviness. The band released a lengthy-but-lurid eight track EP titled Finis Omnium Ignoratium, completing their contract with Vicious Instinct Records. \n\nNo longer satisfied with their status as a terrifying trio, the band sought to expand—searching South Africa for more like-minded musicians willing to bring forth brutality. \nVulvodynia‟s search was not in vain as they found Drummer Thomas Hughes (Fuzigish), Guitarist Kris Xenopoulos \n(Technopath), Bassist Chris Van Der Walt (Boargazm) & Lwandile Prusent to join the band. \n\nWith a full-fledged line-up confirmed, the band made \ntheir first moves with a signing to the legendary Czech-based label Lacerated Enemy Records. After signing to LE Records the band released their third studio album „Psychosadistic Design‟ along with their debut music video for the song „Flesh Tailor‟, The band then embarked on their first EU Tour in 2017 and went abroad twice more for Deathfeast Open Air (DE) & Fall In The Brawl (UK).In 2018 The band embarked on 2 tours through Europe as well as performed at Obscene Extreme Open Air. 2019 saw the band release their 4th studio album ‘Mob Justice’ which sent them touring the US and Australia/New Zealand for the first time as well as 2 Europe tours and a massive festival run.-- proof that there is no way to predict just how far or how fast Vulvodynia‟s sinister infection will spread.",
